= xGhosted: Keep Your X Presence Clean!

xGhosted is a Tampermonkey userscript that helps you hunt down "hanging chads" on X—replies tied to deleted, hidden, or otherwise problematic posts that can drag down account quality. The script scans reply threads, surfaces risky posts, and bundles tools like Auto Delete, CSV export, and diagnostics so you stay in control of your visibility.

== Highlights
* *Instant Post Triage* – Flagged replies are tagged inline with clear severity indicators.
* *Thread Context* – Jump from a reply to its parent chain without losing your place.
* *Auto Delete* – Automatically remove flagged replies from your own `/with_replies` timeline.
* *Exports & Metrics* – Copy suspect URLs or export full CSV data for audits.
* *Panel Controls* – A draggable, theme-aware control panel keeps every action one click away.

== Install The Published Userscript (Most Users)
1. Install link:https://www.tampermonkey.net[Tampermonkey] for your browser.
2. Open the latest built script: https://github.com/ajw1970/X-Ghosted/raw/main/src/xGhosted.user.js
3. Tampermonkey prompts you to review the code. Click *Install*.
4. Visit any X page. The xGhosted panel appears in the lower-right corner and begins scanning when you press *Scan*.

== Develop Or Build Locally

=== Prerequisites
* Node.js 20 LTS (or newer) and npm 10+
* Git
* A modern browser with Tampermonkey for testing

=== Clone And Install
[,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/ajw1970/X-Ghosted.git
cd X-Ghosted
npm install
----

=== Build The Userscript
[,bash]
----
npm run build
----

The build script runs TypeScript (`tsc`) and bundles everything via `build-xGhosted.js`. The generated userscript is written to `src/xGhosted.user.js`. Each build also refreshes shared utilities under `window.XGhostedUtils` for browser injection.

=== Run Tests
[,bash]
----
npm test
----

Vitest executes the unit suite (with coverage) so you can catch regressions before publishing.

=== Load A Local Build Into Tampermonkey
1. Run `npm run build` so `src/xGhosted.user.js` is current.
2. In Tampermonkey, click *Create a new script*.
3. Replace the placeholder contents with the freshly built file.
4. Press *Save*, then reload X. Future `npm run build` executions require re-pasting the file (or use Tampermonkey's "File URL" sync if you self-host it).

== Project Layout
* `src/` – Core application code (panel UI, scanners, managers, utilities).
* `docs/` – AsciiDoc documentation, including deep dives and troubleshooting.
* `samples/` – Static HTML captures of real timelines for regression testing.
* `build-*.sh` / `build-xGhosted.js` – Tooling for bundling and generating the final userscript.
